# Java 13

[JDK 13](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/13/) will be released to the general public on September 17th, 2019.

## Selected new or improved potential features

At the time of writing (July 2019), JDK 13 has not yet been released.
Given the [relase schedule](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/3) and the fact, that Rampdown Phase One for JDK 13 began on June 13th, 2019, the following JEPs are highly lightly (but not guaranteed) to be part of JDK 13 when it reaches general availability.

- [Dynamic CDS Archives](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/350)
- [Switch Expressions (Preview)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/354)
- [Text Blocks (Preview)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/355)
