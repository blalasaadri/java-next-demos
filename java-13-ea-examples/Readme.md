# Java 13

[JDK 13](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/13/) will be released to the general public on September 17th, 2019.
It is currently in [Rampdown Phase Two](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jdk-dev/2019-July/003170.html), which means that the feature set is frozen.
Early access builds are [available](http://jdk.java.net/13/) for Linux, macOS, Windows and Alpine Linux (the later working with the [musl C library](http://www.musl-libc.org/)).

## Selected new or improved potential features

At the time of writing (July 2019), JDK 13 has not yet been released.
Given the [relase schedule](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/3) and the fact, that Rampdown Phase One for JDK 13 began on June 13th, 2019, the following JEPs are highly lightly (but not guaranteed) to be part of JDK 13 when it reaches general availability.

- [JEP 350: Dynamic CDS Archives](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/350) (check the [JDK 13 EA build 22 release notes](https://jdk.java.net/13/release-notes#JDK-8207812) for instructions)
- [JEP 345: Switch Expressions (Preview)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/354) (not to be confused with [JEP 325: Switch Expressions (Preview)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/325), which was part of JDK 12)
- [JEP 355: Text Blocks (Preview)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/355) (replaces [JEP 326: Raw String Literals (Preview)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/326))
